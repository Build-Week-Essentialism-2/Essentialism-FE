# Essentialism-FE

## Problem
-  More and more people are listening to companies that don’t have their best interests at heart.  Companies profiteering from the modern compulsion to fill every spare second of their lives.  This compulsion compromises the mental health of an increasing number of people.  

- We can add another First World Problem to the list; the irrational fear of boredom.  For those who know they are stressed and want to claim their life back, but don’t know how.  They want to know, how can I put a stop to this stress??

## Solution
-  A refuge for the digitally overwhelmed.  
- We provide a means to re-empower people to trust their gut.  To not be afraid of saying “No”, to fail, or to miss out. 
- Our app meets people where they are at.  This is a means of imperfect action towards a goal of simplifying a person’s life.  We give them simple tools in which to question whether their everyday obligations and activities align with their long-term goals.
- Our app helps you to deconstruct what is going on in your life.  So that you can re-build it with a purpose-led approach.

## Our Customer
- Career professsionals aged 25+.  They have a full diary, but feel they achieve nothing of substance.  They are looking to achieve a greater sense of personal satisfaction. Plus, they want their daily activites to align with what is important to them.
